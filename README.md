# hello-world
I luv burriots.
I know nothing about programming. I am a busy prfessional, have an MBA and good job. I love learning. I want to continue educating myself without increasing my student loan debt! This is an amazing community to participate in that can enable and promote my personal growth while organizing my contribution into a greater good for a non profit. I'm excited.
